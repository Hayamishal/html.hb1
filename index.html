	<h2 id="specialstyle"> A Sammary of me</h2>  
 <p> My name is Haya Ben Abu, 31, from Kfar Saba, originally from Ashdod. <br> Married to the 
stunning husband Aviran+ sweety in my belly ðŸ˜Š.<br/> </p>

 <p> I have two cats at home that I'm crazy about... Mawow and Chucha. I adopted them about two years ago.<br> I really like cats, it's a love that developed in me many years ago by a vegan friend I met at my work.<br> Since then everything is history..<br/>
 </p>

 <p> I am very good at massager, I would give massages to my girlfriends and classmates out of pleasure and a hobby..<br> so called I got this talent from birth..<br> and about ten years ago I took the talent one step further and studied a medical massage course at Ashdod College.<br>
 </p>

 <p>I am a graduate of Sapir Academic College, I studied a bachelor's degree in humanities and social sciences .<br> It's a humanitarian degree that gave me a lot of knowledge and life enrichment.
 </p>

 <p> At the same time, he did not open a professional path for me.<br> I have thought a lot in the last few months about how I can find a field that interests me, and of course will reward me accordingly.<br> After some inquiries I heard about QA studies and from that moment I knew it was it. <br> Within a week I signed up for Gal Matlon's course and I am very satisfied.
